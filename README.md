# SimpleProjects
Short Simple Projects in SQL and Python
Project 1: Amateur Central Dogman Converter. This project utilizes dictionary and arrays as well as tuples to take files (fasta, txt) and convert them into their respective peptide chains.
The first class converts DNA into mRNA. mRNA is then converted into tRNA. tRNA is then converted to peptides. 
Dictionaries were a core focus with this project as they contained all the reference information surrounding nucleotides and codons to make the conversion possible. 
This project was aimed at understanding string manipulation and the utilization of vanilla python.

Project 2: This project is an attempt at creating a normalized database design surrounding a fictional Beauty Supply Store.
